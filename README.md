# Alphabet_Recognition_Gestures
This deep learning application in python recognizes alphabet through gestures captured real time on a webcam. The user is allowed to write the alphabet on the screen using an object-of-interest.
# Resource Requirements
The code is in Python (version 3.6 or higher). You also need to install OpenCV(4.4.0 version) and Keras (2.1.3 version) and tensorflow (2.3.1) libraries.
# Data Description 
A popular demonstration of the capability of deep learning techniques is object recognition in image data.

The "Extended Hello World" of object recognition for machine learning and deep learning is the [EMNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist) dataset for handwritten letters recognition. It is an extended version of the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset.

A set of sample images is shown below.
